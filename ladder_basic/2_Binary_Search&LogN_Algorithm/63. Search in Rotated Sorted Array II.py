Follow up for Search in Rotated Sorted Array:

What if duplicates are allowed?

Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.

Example
Given [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1] and target = 0, return true.
Given [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] and target = 0, return false.
